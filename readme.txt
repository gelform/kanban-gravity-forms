Create tasks on your Kanban board using Gravity Forms forms.

== Description ==

This is an add-on plugn for [Kanban for WordPress](https://KanbanWP.com). Allow visitors, users, or clients to create tasks easily from Gravity Forms.

Note: This plugin also requires the paid plugin, [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/).

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you've got Kanban for WordPress and Gravity Forms installed and activated.
1. Create the form people will use to create tasks. Use "select" field types if you want a dropdown for choosing a task attribute, like who the task should be assigned to. Use a "hidden" field type if you want to set a default, like all new tasks should be added to the Backlog status.
1. Activate the Kanban + Gravity Forms plugin. This will create a new Kanban > Gavity Forms page in your WordPress admin.
1. On that Kanban > Gavity Forms page, choose your form from the dropdown at the top of the page.
1. From the fields that show up, choose your Kanban board where tasks should be created, and map each form field to the task attribute. If it's a hidden field, you'll see a second dropdown for choosing the default.
1. Save your changes, and when the form is submitted it will create a new task on your board. If you've got the board open in another tab, you'll see the live update.
